# The Pythonic Way

An Architect’s Guide to Conventions and Best Practices for the Design, Development, Testing, and Management of Enterprise Python Code

This is the repository for [The Pythonic Way](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/the-pythonic-way?_pos=1&_sid=7ffcdca7f&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
‘The Pythonic Way' acquaints you with Python's capabilities beyond basic syntax. This book will help you understand widely accepted Pythonic constructs and procedures, thus enabling you to write reliable, optimized, and modular applications.

You'll learn about Pythonic data structures, class and object creation, and more. The book then delves into some of Python's lesser-known but incredibly powerful functionalities such as meta-programming, decorators, context managers, generators, and iterators. Additionally, you'll learn how to accelerate computations by using Pandas Series and Dataframes. You will be introduced to various design patterns that work well with Python applications. Finally, we'll discuss testing frameworks and best practices for testing, packaging, launching, and publishing applications in production environments.

This book will empower you as you transition from beginner or competitive Python coding to industry-standard Python software development. Intermediate Python developers will gain a deeper understanding of the language's nuances, enabling them to create better software.
